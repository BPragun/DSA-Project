Queuing Patients

This is a simple DSA project to Queue Patients according to treatment priority.
It is simple and easy to use, it can be used to input the patient details and insert the patient in a queue and the patient detail is displayed i.e whose turn arrives for treatment according to priority.
The major focus of this project is to provide priority for old aged people as they are higher in priority in the queue compared to normal patients.
